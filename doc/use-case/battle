# Feature: As a player I want to gain experience through fighting

Given I go any direction
When I arrive in the next room
And There is an enemy in room
Then I need to select if I want to fight or run away

Given There is an enemy in room
When I select run away
Then I can go any direction

Given There is an enemy in room
When I select fight
Then I lose health
And Enemy loses health

Given I fight enemy
When Enemy dies
Then I lose health
And I gain experience from Enemy's experience coefficient

Given I fight enemy
When I die
Then Game exists
